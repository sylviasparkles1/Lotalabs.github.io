<h1>Namespaces</h1>
* Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters â€” they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other.
* When the cluster is initially set up, default namespaces are created to group pods, microservices or resource into one namespace. The second namespace set is Kube-system and then the Kube-public.
